# poppy

This repository contains three projects: 

The first one, `poppy-plays` is a simple library used for playing no-limit Texas Hold'em poker.
It is built on top of [rs_poker](https://crates.io/crates/rs-poker) and exposes simple APIs for implementing a poker game.

The second one is called `poppy-knows`. It encorporates the backbone of the player AI: Briefly, it implements all the cool stuff.

Finally `poppy` is an example to show off. It provides a simple front-end and enables you to play against the AI.

Take a look into the projects' READMEs for detailed information.
